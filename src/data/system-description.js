  introBlurb: `In British Columbia, hiking makes up a large share of outdoor activities undertaken by individuals. Surveys suggest that 7 out of 10 adults in BC have gone hiking just in 2022 alone. In addition to this, another survey by Tourism Northern BC, 2,010,734 households in BC report above average for Hiking/Backpacking. Majority of hikes in BC do not have cell coverage, creating a gap in the hiker’s last known whereabouts from the time they leave to the time they return. In SAR operations, time constraints and communication issues can prove to be major challenges. Having a reference point to start, e.g. a hiker’s last known whereabouts, would aid in these operations.`,
  systemBlurb: `This is where TrekCheck comes in. TrekCheck is a digital trail checkpoint and progress monitoring system that allows the user to log their current location over a certain interval across the trail. The hiker carries an RFID tag and scans the tags at poles that are laid throughout the hike. When a hiker scans their tag, the system logs their last known location with the timestamp and uses satellite communication to transmit this information to a cloud database. From that database, the information is updated on both the Hiker Portal and SAR Dashboard. The Hiker Portal is used by the hiker's emergency contact to monitor their trip and the SAR Dashboard is utilized by the SAR teams to find the hiker’s last location before they leave to perform rescue operations.`
